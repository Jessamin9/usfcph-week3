Conditional logic: If this is true, then do that. 
Chained logic: First do this, then do that. 
Iterative logic: For each of this, do that. 
House analogy: HTML and CSS is the infrastructure of the house... Javascript is the directions on how to build the house. 
Pizza exercise: Steps to grab a slice of pizza. 1. Stand up. 2. Move desktop. 3. Walk forward about 5 steps. 4. Turn to the left. 5. Walk forward about 5 steps. 6. Open pepperoni pizza box. 7. Reach down and grab slice. 8. Place the slice on a paper plate. 9. Grab a napkin. 10. Turn around, walk forward about 5 steps. 11. Turn right, walk forward about 5 steps. 12. Sit down. 
Flows: Thought patterns that describe an action. 
Concept vs. Syntax: Words and their meaning in a digital context. 
Primitives in JavaScript: Boolean:(true and false), Strings:(words), Numbers, Null:(an empty value, intentionally setting the value to empty like an empty pizza box), and undefined:(the absence of a value). 
"const": constant, not changing ever. 
"let": the value for now, but it might change. 
Objects in JavaScript: Object= An item with nestable properties. Array= A list of things. Date= ex. 10-16-2019. 
For example, someone's weight would be expressed as: "person.weight = 129;" 
In an array, the list always starts at 0. For example, (1,2,3,4) the number "1" would techically be considered "0". 
Functions and conditionals: Functions: the verbs of programming. For example, instead of listing all the steps involved in getting a slice of pizza, they can be grouped together in a function like "getPizza". Conditionals: If + else if + else: "if this, then that..." This is the simplest way to define conditional logic. Switches: a more condensed version; they test a bunch of values for a given input, basically, it's a stricter version of "if + else if". Ternaries: The shorthand version of "if + else if". Short circuit: An emergency brake code. 
"For" "ForEach": for every thing in the array, here's the function that needs to be completed. 
Classes: More common in languages like Python and Java. Used to describe nouns. Have helper methods. Commonly used in React prior to 2019. 
React + npm: NPM= (Node Packaging Manager) a library of open source software. Command Line Interface (CLI) tool for managing dependencies. Build less of the nuts and bolts; Focus on finding good packages and adding value. React= Open source project from Facebook; used to build websites and mobile apps. Most popular front end framework (as of writing). Highly customizable as almost everything is a component. It uses tags, which is similar to how HTML works.
